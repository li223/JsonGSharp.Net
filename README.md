# This thing is so broken and just a massive mistake like me. :^)

# JsonGSharp.Net
Don't ask, Don't tell.


# What is this
You know. I ask myself everytime I look at it. 
I just wanted to be cool, you know?
All the cool kids were doing it, so like how I am with random things I find in the medicine cabinet, I decided to try it.

# Oh wait. Install?
1) Download the repo

2) Open it in Visual Studio (or whatever IDE you want I guess)

3) Build it

4) Add it as a reference to your project/program

5) Install System.Drawing.Common and Newtonsoft.Json from Nuget to your program

6) ???

7) If it breaks then well. BLEH
